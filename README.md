## 🤔 Why I Built This
As a frontend developer diving into React.js, I wanted to create a practical project that demonstrates API integration, dynamic UI updates, and state management. A Weather App was the perfect choice because it involves fetching real-time data, handling asynchronous requests, and providing user-friendly interactions. This project strengthened my understanding of React hooks, API handling, and Tailwind CSS.
